# MIT Ph.D. Thesis template in LyX

This project is a port of the popular LaTeX template by [Kyle Jensen](https://github.com/kljensen). I enjoy as much WYSIWYG as I can get and LyX has always been a nice in-between. This is literally a port of Kyle's thesis content so the dissertation itself is his. Big thank you to Kyle for providing such a well formed template to work with. 

This is a [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) template for a Ph.D. thesis at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu).

Here are the instructions to get going:

* Make sure you perofrm all of the needed instructions by Kyle in [his original project](https://github.com/kljensen/mit-phd-thesis).
* You'll need to install the class file to your $TEXMF directory. I tried to make this as easy as possible with the cls2layout.sh script. You can run it with a simple:

``bash
$ ./cls2layout.sh mitthesis.cls
``

Final note: It can be done! I have successfully graduated in 2017 using this template. :-)
